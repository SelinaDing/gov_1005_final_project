# Olympic Success and Voter Turnout Rates
### Topic
This is an analysis looking at the relationship between US Olympic success (defined below) as it relates to United States voting turnout rates.
### Explanation
I am interested in social effects of the Olympics beyond instilling a sense of patriotism and pride from success in international competition. Specifically, I hypothesize that within the United States (a capitalist, individualistic nation), seeing fellow compatriots succeed on an international level will be correlated with an increase in voter turnout in the subsequent election (be it presidential or midterm).
### Olympic Success
"Olympic Success" can have very many definitions, so I am looking at it in a number of ways. Variables to explore include position in total medal count, gold medal percentage of total gold medals awarded, all medal percentage of total medals awarded, percentage change in gold medals from the previous Olympic Games, percentage change in all medals from the previous Olympic Games, and specific cases of impressive United States performance in various sports in the Olympics.
